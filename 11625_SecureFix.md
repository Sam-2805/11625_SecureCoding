## 🔐 Stored XSS Fix – CVE‑2023‑2323 (Pimcore)

### 🧩 Vulnerability Overview

**Type**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
**CVE ID**: CVE‑2023‑2323  
**Affected Product**: Pimcore (prior to version 10.5.21)  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Description**:  
A stored XSS vulnerability existed in Pimcore where the `name` fields in various UI components (such as Pricing Rules and Reports) allowed attackers to inject malicious scripts. These scripts could later be executed when an admin viewed the affected UI pages.

---

### 🛡️ Root Cause

The application directly output user input (e.g., from `$this->getName()`) without output encoding, allowing malicious JavaScript to be rendered and executed in the browser.

---

### 🛠️ Patch & Fix

To mitigate this vulnerability, Pimcore developers applied output encoding using PHP’s `htmlspecialchars()` function, which escapes HTML special characters and prevents script execution.

### ✅ Patched Code Snippet:
```diff
- $name = $this->getName();
+ $name = htmlspecialchars($this->getName(), ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
```

# 🧠 Secure Coding Principles

## 1. Input Validation

Make sure the data coming into the app is clean and safe.

1. Always validate on the **server**, even if validation is also performed in the browser.
2. Treat **all data as untrusted** — including files, database values, headers, or cookies.
3. Use a **central validation function** to ensure consistent rules throughout the application.
4. Prefer **allowlisting** of known-safe characters (letters, numbers) over denylisting.
5. Check input **type, length, format, and range**.  
   _Example: Age must be a number between 0–120._
6. Watch for **dangerous characters**: `<`, `>`, `'`, `%`, `../`, and null bytes (`%00`).
7. Apply **canonicalization** to convert alternate encodings (e.g., double-encoded values) to a standard form before validation.

## 2. Output Encoding

Ensure data sent to users cannot run code in their browsers (prevent XSS).

1. **Encode output** before displaying it on any web page, especially user-provided content.
2. Use **context-specific encoding**:  
   - HTML → `htmlspecialchars()`  
   - JavaScript → JSON encoding  
   - URLs → URL encoding
3. Sanitize user input in **structured queries** like SQL, XML, and LDAP to prevent injection.
4. Escape unsafe characters like `<`, `"`, and `&`.
5. Never assume input is safe just because it passed validation — **always encode before output**.
6. Use **well-tested encoding libraries**, not custom-written solutions.

---

## 3. Authentication & Password Management

Protect user credentials and login functionality.

1. Enforce **strong password policies** — long, complex, and unique.
2. Hash and salt passwords before storage using secure algorithms like **bcrypt** or **Argon2**.
3. Do not indicate which login field failed — just show: “Invalid credentials”.
4. Implement **account lockouts** after several failed attempts to stop brute-force attacks.
5. Use **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for sensitive accounts or actions.
6. Never store passwords in code or in plain text — **encrypt and secure** them.

---

## 4. Session Management

Manage user sessions securely to avoid hijacking or fixation attacks.

1. Use **secure, random session IDs** generated server-side.
2. Set cookies as:
   - `HttpOnly` (unreadable by JavaScript)
   - `Secure` (sent only over HTTPS)
3. Properly end sessions on **logout** or **inactivity timeout**.
4. Generate a **new session ID upon login** to prevent fixation attacks.
5. **Do not pass session IDs in URLs** — use secure cookies instead.
6. Periodically **rotate session IDs** to limit exposure even if compromised.

---

## 5. Access Control

Ensure users only access what they’re authorized to.

1. Perform **authorization checks server-side** on every request.
2. Do not rely on hidden form fields or URLs for enforcing access control.
3. Use a **centralized access control mechanism** to avoid inconsistencies.
4. Restrict access to sensitive URLs, files, APIs, and functions.
5. Separate **admin features** from standard user features and data paths.
6. Re-evaluate user roles/permissions **periodically** during long sessions.
